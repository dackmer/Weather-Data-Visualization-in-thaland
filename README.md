# Weather Data Visualization Application

This application allows users to visualize weather data from a CSV file.

## Introduction

Weather Data Visualization Application is a simple tool designed to help users visualize weather data stored in a CSV file. The application provides various options to display weather data in graphical formats such as histograms, line charts, and bar charts.

## Features

- Visualize weather data using histograms, line charts, and bar charts.
- Customize graph titles, labels, and colors.
- Compare data between different time periods, locations, or weather conditions.
- View all data in the CSV file using a table.
